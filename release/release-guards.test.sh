# The guards that need neither a repository nor a network, exercised through the
# same subcommand dispatch every caller uses. The guards path is an argument so
# the copy under test can be named: nix builds this in a sandbox holding a
# shebang-patched copy, never the checkout.
#
# `releaseGuardsTest` in flake.nix hands this to consumers as a check of their
# own rather than something they inherit as already-passed. A consumer gates it
# under its own nixpkgs -- its own bash, awk, sort and grep -- at the dull-nix
# revision its lockfile pins, which is not the revision this repository's gate
# last ran. Between those two points sit every lockfile the consumer has not
# updated and every tool version it resolves differently, and the guards decide
# what may be published, so "it passed somewhere else, once" is not the
# assurance wanted.
#
# `conventional-bump` reads NUL-separated records, because a commit message
# contains blank lines and `git log --format='%B%x00'` is what feeds it. Hence
# `expect_stdout_of_escaped`, which is `expect_stdout` with `printf %b` so a
# case can write `\0` between messages and `\n` inside one.
